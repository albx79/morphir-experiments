# Morphir Experiments

Some experiments using [Morphir](https://morphir.finos.org/) and [Zio](https://zio.dev).

This is a toy project to model the "business logic" of the tabletop role play game 
["Scum and Villainy"](https://evilhat.com/product/scum-and-villainy/) and create a Game Master's helper app 
in Scala.
